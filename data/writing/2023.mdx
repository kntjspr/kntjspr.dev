Compared to previous years, this year has been quite a rollercoaster ride to me. I have encountered both the most broken and the strongest versions of myself. I have experienced a mix of great and terrible things. I have met many new people and made friends, but I have also lost many individuals whom I thought would be in my life forever. The setbacks and challenges I have faced this year have been unbelievable, but the rewards and lessons I have learned are priceless.


**Now, let me provide a detailed recap of what has happened in my life this year:**


At the beginning of the year, I was already working as a developer specializing in automation. I had a great circle of friends, a supportive partner, and a successful career. Everything seemed to be going smoothly until I encountered one of the biggest setbacks in my life. I lost the people I loved the most and those who had been by my side for years. I faced dilemmas in both romantic and platonic relationships.


This took a toll on my mental health, causing me to perform poorly in school and eventually leading me to stop working due to my inability to cope with a hectic schedule. My life took a complete turn of 180 degrees. I turned 18, and after struggling through painful nights, I finally found the courage to accept my losses.


I embarked on a journey of self-improvement, starting with small changes and gradually working towards achieving my life goals. I faced numerous relapses along the way, and the journey was far from easy; however, I remained committed to it. I successfully graduated from my senior high academic track and took an entrance exam, which led to my acceptance of one of the largest universities in my city. I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science.


I have never been fond of joining organizations, let alone taking on leadership roles. However, this time, I decided to leave the comfort zone. I applied for a position at Google Developer Student Clubs and was accepted as a Sponsorship Manager.


I got into competitive programming and acquired certificates. Iâ€™m currently working to further improve my skills


Overall, the journey is challenging, but it is worthwhile.


## Advice:


This year, probably gave me the most lessons. Here are some of the best lessons I have learnedt.


- Time does not wait for anyone. Regardless of the circumstances or losses, time will not stop accommodating feelings. As cruel as this concept may be, it teaches us to move on.
- Spend more time with people who energize you.
- Enjoy your journey. Everything is temporary, so cherish every moment, and never take things for granted.
- Comparison can serve as a guide, but don't compare yourself to others. Instead, compare yourself to who you were yesterday.
- If you cannot decide, the answer is no.
- Choose the most painful or uncomfortable path, as it often yields the greatest long-term benefits.
- Put yourself and your work out there every single day.
- Having standards is good. Set standards for yourself and for others.
- Focus on building yourself first before working with others.
- You only need to prove things to yourself, not others.
- There are better people out there; you just have to find them. Just because something is presented to you doesn't mean it's good for you.
- Ask questions. Ask the correct questions.
- You're only going to be as good as the people you surround yourself.
- To shorten the learning curve, teach.
