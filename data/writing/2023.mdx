## Intro


Compared to previous years, this year has been quite a rollercoaster ride for me. I have come across both the most shattered and the most resilient forms of my own self.


The setbacks and challenges I have faced this year have been unbelievable, but the rewards and lessons I have learned are priceless.


**Now, let me provide a detailed recap of what has happened in my life this year:**

## Year summary


At the beginning of the year, I was working as an automation developer and had a great group of friends. My career was going well, and everything seemed to be on track. However, I faced a major setback that brought various challenges and dilemmas into my life.


This took a toll on my mental health, causing me to perform poorly in school and eventually leading me to stop working due to my inability to cope with a hectic schedule. My life took a complete 180-degree turn. I turned 18, and after struggling through painful nights, I finally found the courage to accept my losses.


I embarked on a journey of self-improvement, beginning with small changes and gradually working towards enhancing my personal well-being. Along the way, I encountered numerous setbacks, and the journey was far from easy; nevertheless, my commitment remained unwavering. 


I successfully completed my senior high academic track, and after taking an entrance exam, I was accepted into one of the largest universities in my city where I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science.


I am not really fond of joining organizations, and I am especially not eager to take on leadership positions. But this time, I consciously chose to go beyond my comfort zone. I applied for a position at <a href="https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc">Google Developer Student Clubs</a>, and after a challenging interview process, I was humbly given the role of sponsorship manager. I also delved into competitive programming, earning several certificates, and I am currently focused on further enhancing my skills..


Moreover, I had the privilege of encountering remarkable individuals who have become an integral part of my daily life. Each person has made a distinct impact on me, shaping my beliefs and contributing to my personal growth. I never anticipated having the opportunity to live a life like this again."


2023 has been a truly amazing year, where I was able to change my perspective on life and people in general, while also achieving most of my goals. It was definitely challenging, but also rewarding in some aspects.

## Advice:


This year imparted upon me the most valuable insights. Here are some of the valuable lessons I acquired.


- Time is not influenced by anyone or any circumstances, and it teaches us to keep moving forward regardless of any difficulties or setbacks.
- Surround yourself with those who bring you energy.
- Pray before and after ending the day, as it will help you cultivate a deep sense of focus and stay grounded in what truly matters. This will provide clarity and inner stability, enabling you to navigate life's challenges with greater resilience and purpose.
- If you cannot decide, the answer is no.
- Choose the most painful or uncomfortable path, as it often yields the greatest long-term benefits.
- Put yourself and your work out there every single day.
- Having standards is good. Set a standard for yourself and for others.
- You only need to prove things to yourself.
- Just because something is presented to you doesn't mean it's good for you.
- You're only going to be as good as the people you surround yourself with.
- To shorten the learning curve, teach.
