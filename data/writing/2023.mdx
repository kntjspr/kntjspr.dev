Compared to previous years, this year has been quite a rollercoaster ride for me. I have encountered both the most broken and the strongest versions of myself. I have experienced a mix of great and terrible things. I have met many new people and made friends, but I have also lost many individuals whom I thought would be in my life forever. 


The setbacks and challenges I have faced this year have been unbelievable, but the rewards and lessons I have learned are priceless.


**Now, let me provide a detailed recap of what has happened in my life this year:**


At the beginning of the year, I was already working as a developer specializing in automation. I had a great circle of friends, a supportive partner, and a successful career. Everything seemed to be going smoothly until I encountered one of the biggest setbacks in my life. I lost the people I loved the most and those who had been by my side for years. I faced dilemmas in both romantic and platonic relationships.


This took a toll on my mental health, causing me to perform poorly in school and eventually leading me to stop working due to my inability to cope with a hectic schedule. My life took a complete 180-degree turn. I turned 18, and after struggling through painful nights, I finally found the courage to accept my losses.


I embarked on a journey of self-improvement, starting with small changes and gradually working towards achieving my life goals. I faced numerous relapses along the way, and the journey was far from easy; however, I remained committed to it. I successfully graduated from my senior high academic track and took an entrance exam, which led to my acceptance of one of the largest universities in my city. I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science.


I have never been fond of joining organizations, let alone taking on leadership roles. However, this time, I decided to leave my comfort zone. I applied for a position at Google Developer Student Clubs and was accepted as a sponsorship manager.


I got into competitive programming and acquired certificates. Iâ€™m currently working to further improve my skills.


Overall, the journey was challenging, but it was worthwhile.


## Advice:


This year likely imparted upon me the most valuable insights. Here are some of the valuable lessons I acquired.


- Time waits for no one. Regardless of situations or setbacks, time is indifferent to emotions. Although this may seem harsh, it imparts the lesson of progressing forward.
- Surround yourself with those who bring you energy.
- Enjoy your journey. Everything is temporary, so cherish every moment, and never take things for granted.
- Comparison provides guidance when used properly. Avoid comparing with others; rather, compare with your past self.
- If you cannot decide, the answer is no.
- Choose the most painful or uncomfortable path, as it often yields the greatest long-term benefits.
- Put yourself and your work out there every single day.
- Having standards is good. Set a standard for yourself and for others.
- Focus on building yourself first before working with others.
- You only need to prove things to yourself, not others.
- There are better people out there; you just have to find them. Just because something is presented to you doesn't mean it's good for you.
- Ask questions. Ask the correct questions.
- You're only going to be as good as the people you surround yourself with.
- To shorten the learning curve, teach.
