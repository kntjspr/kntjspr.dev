## Intro


Compared to previous years, this year has been quite a rollercoaster ride for me. I have come across both the most shattered and the most resilient forms of my own self. I've had ups and downs. I've made friends and lost some too.


The setbacks and challenges I have faced this year have been unbelievable, but the rewards and lessons I have learned are priceless.


**Now, let me provide a detailed recap of what has happened in my life this year:**

## Year summary


At the beginning of the year, I was already working as a developer specializing in automation. I had a great circle of friends, and a successful career. Everything seemed to be going smoothly until I encountered one of the biggest setbacks in my life. I faced dilemmas mostly in relationships.


This took a toll on my mental health, causing me to perform poorly in school and eventually leading me to stop working due to my inability to cope with a hectic schedule. My life took a complete 180-degree turn. I turned 18, and after struggling through painful nights, I finally found the courage to accept my losses.


I embarked on a journey of self-improvement, beginning with small changes and gradually working towards enhancing my personal well-being. Along the way, I encountered numerous setbacks, and the journey was far from easy; nevertheless, my commitment remained unwavering. I successfully completed my senior high academic track, and after taking an entrance exam, I was accepted into one of the largest universities in my city where I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science.


I am not really fond of joining organizations, and I am especially not eager to take on leadership positions. But this time, I consciously chose to go beyond my comfort zone. I applied for a position at <a href="https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc">Google Developer Student Clubs</a>, and after a challenging interview process, I was humbly given the role of sponsorship manager. I also got into competitive programming and acquired numerous certificates and Iâ€™m currently working to further improve my skills.

I also had the privilege of meeting many incredible individuals who became an integral part of my daily life. Each person left a distinct impact on me, shaping my beliefs and contributing to my personal growth. I had never anticipated that I would have the opportunity to live a life like this again.

2023 has been a truly amazing year, where I was able to change my perspective on life and people in general, while also achieving most of my goals. It was definitely challenging, but also rewarding in some aspects.

## Advice:


This year imparted upon me the most valuable insights. Here are some of the valuable lessons I acquired.


- Time is not influenced by anyone or any circumstances, and it teaches us to keep moving forward regardless of any difficulties or setbacks.
- Surround yourself with those who bring you energy.
- Pray before and after ending the day, as it will help you cultivate a deep sense of focus and stay grounded in what truly matters. This will provide clarity and inner stability, enabling you to navigate life's challenges with greater resilience and purpose.
- If you cannot decide, the answer is no.
- Choose the most painful or uncomfortable path, as it often yields the greatest long-term benefits.
- Put yourself and your work out there every single day.
- Having standards is good. Set a standard for yourself and for others.
- You only need to prove things to yourself.
- Just because something is presented to you doesn't mean it's good for you.
- You're only going to be as good as the people you surround yourself with.
- To shorten the learning curve, teach.
